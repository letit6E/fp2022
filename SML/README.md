### Features done:

- Parser
- Type inferencer
- Interpreter
- Unit tests

### Features details:

- Parser based on abstract syntactic tree
- Type inferencer supports generic type variables, equality types, value restriction, errors check and printing, types printing
- Interpreter in combination with type inferencer
- Unit tests for parser and interpreter with type inferencer

### Mini-language supports

- Int, String, Bool, Tuple, List, Option types
- Functions, lambda, recursive functions
- Generic types, equality types, restricted generic and equality values
- Binary and unary operators, pattern matching, let...in binding, if statements

and etc., more examples in tests.
